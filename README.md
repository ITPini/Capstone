## Introduction
Digital image processing refers to the use of software to manipulate and enhance digital images. One
common technique in digital image processing, I want to develop my capstone project around, is the
manipulation of individual color channels in a bitmap image.

The goal of this capstone project is to develop a desktop application in Java, which allows for the
manipulation of individual color channels in a bitmap image. The application should enable users to import
an image, apply an algorithm to alter the RGB values, and export the final image. For developer, it should
be easy to implement a wide range of algorithms in a flexible manner building on top of my source code.

## Prerequisites
- ``Java >= 19``
- ``Maven >= 3.8.6`` 

(Has not been tested with older versions).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `mvn clean install` in the root directory of the project
3. Build and run `org.aau.pini.capstone.ImageProcessingApp.java`

## Development
